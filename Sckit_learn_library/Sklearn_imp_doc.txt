Install the 64bit version of Python 3, for instance from https://www.python.org.
Then run:

pip install -U scikit-learn
In order to check your installation you can use

python -m pip show scikit-learn  # to see which version and where scikit-learn is installed
python -m pip freeze  # to see all packages installed in the active virtualenv
python -c "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()"
